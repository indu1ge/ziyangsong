Biography
------

I am currently a postgraduate student working with Prof. Wu Weiren and Prof. Zhang Tianzhu at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I got the B.S. degree in Automation at USTC in 2022.

My research interest includes 3D reconstruction, depth estimation and computer vision.
